<h1>Anisa De La Garza</h1>
<p>My name is Anisa. I go to Lehman High School and I am in the 12th grade. I have lived in Kyle Texas my whole life and I love Austin. I like to sing and i like who are nice and caring, I dislike people who are selfish and mean. My favorite color is blue. The current resturants I love are Panda Express, Raising Canes, and Torcy's Tacos. I love to collect jewery and try new things. Halloween is my favorite hoilday and Post Malone is favorite artist in the entire world.</p>
